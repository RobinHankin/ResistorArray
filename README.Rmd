# Overview

The `ResistorArray` package gives functionality for calculating
electrical properties of resistor networks.  Any array of resistors
may be implemented and a number of special arrays are given as data.
For example, a skeleton cube has 8 nodes and a conductance matrix for
unit resistors along each edge is given by `cube()`:

```{r}
cube()
```

A common puzzle is to calculate the resistance of such a cube between
diagonally opposite corners, the answer being $1/3+1/6=1/3=5/6$ (the
trick being to observe that nodes equidistant from the corners are at
the same potential).  This is easily reproduced in the package:


```{r}
resistance(cube(),1,7)
```

However, the trick does not work for general resistances but the
package has no problem:

```{r}
resistance(cube(1:12),1,7)
```

The package includes many other convenience functions; it is still
under development.


# Installation

To install the most recent stable version on CRAN, use
`install.packages()` at the R prompt:


```
R> install.packages("ResistorArray")
```

To install the current development version use `devtools`:

```
R> devtools::install_github("RobinHankin/ResistorArray")
```

And then to load the package use `library()`:


```{r,message=FALSE}
library("ResistorArray")
```
